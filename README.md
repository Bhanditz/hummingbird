![Hummingbird Logo](http://flashapi.org/hummingbird/hummingbird-badges/hummingbird-logo-128.png)
	
The easiest way to build and deploy robust MVC applications for ActionScript 3.0, Mobile and the Starling Framework.

## What is Hummingbird? ##

**Hummingbird** is a light-weight, fast and easy-to-use MVC Framework for the Flash Platform.
It has especially been designed for the development of Starling-based games.

**Hummingbird** focuses on Adobe AIR, but is fully compatible with Flex Apache and pure ActionScript 3.0 environments. It can be used for Mobile applications as well as Desktop applications.

By completely decoupling the good old MVC triad, **Hummingbird** keeps your code concise, simple and modular. 
Thus, it easily enables teams management and maintainability of code.

## Hummingbird Features ##

The **Hummingbird Framework** comes with a huge bunch of built-in functionalities, such as ready-to-use templates, ant builder tasks, sample projects and more...

Because **Hummingbird** uses Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) to deal for you with the MVC pattern architecture, you just have to focus on the business layer of your applications, or games.

Contrary to others signal-based MVC framewoks, **Hummingbird** strictly adheres to the MVC pattern. It means that developers can easily identify producers and consumers of action calls between the actors of the MVC pattern.
